## Robyn
(Wip- about mommy I guess)
In chapter 0, when the party gets in Robyn's appartement, a dreamsscape scene is showed to the player. This scenario includes Atlas and Robyn younger(Middle school?), meeting eachother for the first time.

The scenic is cut by the eruption of what appears to be a nightmarish figure representation of Robyn's mother, entering the room saying "Lights out".

The player is then asked if he wants to take a picture of the "Monster" by "taking this one life time opportunity" by clicking "Yes?".

If the players click one of the two other choices ("I don't want to!" and "I'm scared."), the scenic fades to black and the MC[¹](#annexes) wakes up as the rest of the game goes on.

If the player choosed "Yes?", Robyn then proceeds to take a picture with the polaroid camera as the flash fills the whole room ending up in the same result.

### Psychological analysis 
Despite being shown later in the game that [Lexulathu'al](../Characters/Lex.md) is causing the nightmares, it is still easily applicable that a possible trauma linked to their[²](#annexes) parents enhanced the effects of the nightmare's manifestation.

Later in the game, we can also observe a SMS conversation between Robyn and what seems to be their brother, saying he will visit them someday, even if Robyn thinks he won't because of "Work". This last element then classifies the case as **General family issues.**

## Atlas
(Wip about Atticus)
