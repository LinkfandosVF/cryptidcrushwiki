# The soul 
Fan definition by Linkfandos


In most stuff and representations of persons that don't have a soul-(except Elon Musk)


They seem to not have a Shadow, and their breath doesn't form **heat**, linking to the "flame soul thing" representation of the soul. (Like the whisp on top Jamie's head)


So the soul is a part of your whole being that represents your emotions and being, so without a soul, you have straight cold blood. 


That means that if the person you sold your soul to destroys it or consumes it,


You don't feel anything


You can't feel heat, cold, pain 



You are nobody
