They/Them - Devil

5'10" or 178 CM

Jamie was born on the 27/7.

> "A demon who, after centuries, grew tired of their devilish lifestyle. They instead have tried to live a simpler, peaceful life, or at least as close to one an exhiled demon from Hell can get. Imposing as they may be, Jamie hopes to one day be understood by mortals."


## Look
Jamie is an imposing, muscular demon with an exposed skull on the top half of their head. Jamie has a red skin tone and no hair, instead having a pair of curled horns and a small blue flame on their head. They have long drooping ears, large clawed hands, and hooved feet.
## Lore (WIP)
