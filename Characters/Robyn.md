Robyn Hartz (Or whatever you named them)
They/Them (Or whatever pronouns you gave them)
**For logical reason we're just going to call them Robyn.**

Robyn is a 5'10" tall dark-skinned human with long black curly hairs. They're the main character you play in the game.(Or MC)

They're 20 years old.

## Look
Robyn's style can vary depending on how you answered the Mothman's question in the intro of the game. (See [Atticus](./Atticus.md#)) Their look can either be selected using presets, or changed completely near the end of the intro.
