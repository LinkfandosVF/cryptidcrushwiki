Snow is the defunt¹ wife of the mothman, Atticus² and the mother of Atlas³.
She supposedly passed away(?) soon after Atlas' birth.

**NOTE**: Every information here is BASICALLY GUESSING with Mikey's tumblr posts. Not everything might be canon. It's just a theory⁴.

## Look
Snow is a tall mothman with short antennae and white feathers. She has red glowing eyes and her wings seems to be cut off.

## Side Notes
- Atlas doesn't seem to remember a lot of his mother, but he does keep a damaged picture of her and his dad in his room. The part with snow on the picture is missing and the photography was probably Atticus' propriety. Atlas drew her on a piece of paper that he taped to the back of the picture to fill the missing part.

- Multiple elements in the game shows that Atlas probably grew up with only his father.

- Atlas says doesn't know much about his "species"⁵ (Chapter 1, Day 1), indicating Atticus might have not talked about it with him at ALL.
