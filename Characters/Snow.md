Snow is the defunt¹ wife of the mothman, Atticus².
She supposedly passed away(?) soon after Atlas' birth.

**NOTE**: Every information here is BASICALLY GUESSING with Mikey's tumblr posts. Not everything might be canon. It's just a theory.³ 

## Look
Snow is a tall mothman with short antennae and white feathers. She has red glowing eyes and her wings seems to be cut off.
