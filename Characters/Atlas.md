## Look
Atlas is a short-statured young adult mothman. Atlas has large red eyes with white sclera, thick black hair around his neck, and black antennae. His upper body and wings are silver grey. He does not wear shoes due to his large, taloned feet.

## Side notes
- Atlas's full name is Atlas Indrid. He was born on the 21st of December 1999.

- Atlas is a main character, meaning he's probably going to be romance-able in future updates.

- Despite being a very odd coincidence, Atlas' name does NOT come from the moth species. This fact was busted by Mikey on Tumblr.

- When asking Atticus² for "Dad advices", there's a chance he mentions Atlas not answering his phone calls...
