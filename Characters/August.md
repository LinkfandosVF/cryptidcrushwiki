He/Him - Werewolf

6'0" or 183 CM

> "Wolfman sightings are far from uncommon in Longhope, and while everyone knows it's August, he denies any involvement. In the daytime, August is a single dad who's trying his best to get by."


## Look
In his human form, Gus is a large-statured man. Gus has a light skin tone and wild, neck-length red hair, and a short red beard.

In his werewolf form, he grows considerably taller, his entire body taking on lupine features, including a snout and pointed ears. His hands turn to padded feet, and his hair grows considerably, including thick, dark brown hair on his arms and legs, light brown hair on his chest, and yellow sclera.
