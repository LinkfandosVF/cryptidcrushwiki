> "Mike Madhouse is a radio host turned ghost after a freak accident during the station's Graveyard Slot. Not much is known about this specter but some say he's trapped, cursed to DJ for the rest of eternity... His Fun Riddles segment is a fan favorite!"


## Look
Madhouse Mike is a green ghost, with long hair and a suprising lack of pupils. Madhouse's green appearance is actually due to the way he died, being given the energy drink he was supposed to promote on the line.
