Madhouse Mike
He/Him
His name was Micheal Delarosa, before he became a ghost.

## Look
Madhouse's green appearance is actually due to the way he died, being given the energy drink he was supposed to promote on the line.

*"Seriously, who would trust a brand of the name of 'Toxic waste energy'? He drank so much his skin turned glowing green and he died on the spot!"* - Atlas in Chapter 0 (Elkhorn Radio Station)
## Lore
Madhouse is called multiple times a "urban legend" described as the ghost of Elkhorn Station.

*"He died while advertising a sketchy energy drink brand. He thought that drinking the whole sample box was a good idea. That worked for like, 2 seconds."* - Atlas in Chapter 0 (Elkhorn Radio Station)
